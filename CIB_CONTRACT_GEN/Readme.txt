CIB stands for Credit Information Bureau. Before giving any credit to a customer, bank should send the details of the customer to the central bank for getting all the detailed credit information of that customer. All the banks are responsible to provide the data to the central bank on every specific time. This script generates the data for that purpose. There are several templates for the report. Those are CIB_BORROWER, CIB_CONTRACT, and CIB_GUARANTOR.
