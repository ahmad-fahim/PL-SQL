This script generates the data for Classified Loan(CL). Here I used the oracle job to generate the data in a quick manner. The number of jobs here can be a parameter. So, users can put any number of jobs depending on the machine/processor. The procedure will generate the data according to the branch. So, if there are total 1300 branches in a Bank, and we put the total number of threads as 26, this will automatically fire 26 oracle jobs and each job will precess 50 branches and generate the data.
